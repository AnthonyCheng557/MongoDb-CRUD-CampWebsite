## Fundamentals in CRUD Techniques Using NoSQL MongoDB

This project demonstrates core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a full-stack web application using a **NoSQL MongoDB** database. It features both user and admin workflows to efficiently manage application data.

The system showcases essential concepts in both front-end and back-end development, integrating **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **EJS** templating with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. 

- On the **front end**, HTML provides structure, JavaScript enables interactivity, and **EJS** dynamically renders content based on server-side logic.
- On the **back end**, Node.js and Express manage routing, handle form submissions, and interact with the MongoDB database.
- Users can submit information through application forms, while admins have the ability to view, review, update, and delete user data via rendered administrative views.

This project highlights how different layers of a web application work together to deliver a functional and scalable CRUD-based system.

- **Users** can submit application forms with their personal information, which is then stored in the MongoDB database.
- **Admins** have access to a secure interface where they can:
  - View all user submissions
  - Review and update user details
  - Delete entries when necessary
